            <p>I grew up in Fortaleza and always lived with my parents and oldest sister until I turn 18. I studied during
                high school in a local school in my neighborhood called Novo Horizonte (or "New Horizon" in English). <br>
                I'm an English teacher trying to immigrate to another field. During high school I took an IT course and had
                an internship as a developer. There, I would learn how to use technologies like Angular JS, Django, Django
                REST, node.js etc. Then, I went on a mission and, after coming back, I started working as an English
                teacher. So, actually, I'm trying to reimmigrate to this area. <br> I recently got married to a wonderful
                and lovely woman. Micaela and I have have been together for more than a year and we're now waiting for our
                first baby to come. She's been pregnant for more than 3 months. <br>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur

            <p>Fortaleza ([foʁtaˈlezɐ], Portuguese for Fortress) is the state capital of Ceará, located in Northeastern
