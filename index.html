        <p>I'm an English teacher trying to immigrate to another field. During high school I took an IT course and had an internship as a developer. There, I would learn how to use technologies like Angular JS, Django, Django REST, node.js etc. Then, I went on a mission and, after coming back, I started working as an English teacher. So, actually, I'm trying to reimmigrate to this area.</p>
